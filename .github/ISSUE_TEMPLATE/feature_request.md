# Describe your proposed feature?

As **SpanExtension.Net** provides Extension Methods, your feature should be implementable via **Extension Methods.** 
  
**Describe your feature in detail**

 - Consider comparing it to already existing Methods (e.g. `ReadOnlySpan<T>.Split(T delimiter)` is `string.Split(char delimiter)` but for `ReadOnlySpan<T>`. 
- Give examples on how you would like to consume it.
